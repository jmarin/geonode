Social Features in GeoNode
==========================

GeoNode provides several features that enhance the core capabilities for collaborating in the creation and sharing of geographic information. New features like Groups and Announcements enhance workflows among users, while Tagging and Ratings allow another aspect of data classification that can help find the most relevant content. Last but not least, integration with social media allows users to share geographic content with their contacts.

Social network integration 
==========================

The social network integration feature for GeoNode allows for users to tell their contacts about maps that have been created by themselves or by others.

There are two options to share content with others:

* **Google** +1 button. Google+ allows users to recommend content on Google Search and share it with others on Google+. By clicking on this link users can recommend maps in GeoNode to their contacts or make them accessible to a Google Search. 

* **Facebook** *Like* button. The Facebook *Like* button allows users to share content on a web page with their friends on Facebook. When the user clicks the *Like* button on the GeoNode site, a new post will appear on their News Feed with a link to the GeoNode map

In both cases, the user needs to be logged in into the social network of choice in order to be able to directly publish content. If that is not the case, a standard log in prompt from the appropriate third party provider will be shown.
